## About The Project

This is an ansible project for locally configuring and testing two master-backup proxys balancing over two web servers.
This project has been tested on Vagrant virtual machines using Debian GNU/Linux 10.x Buster/Stable Minimal Install (64 bit) as VM box image.
It is perfectly valid for configuring two remote servers as master-backup servers, by changing the hosts IP addresses and creating an ansible user and granting access. It will also be necessary having a floating IP address (elastic or global).


### Built With

Vagrant and VirtualBox are used to easily create local virtual machines.
Ansible playbooks are used to manage configuration on the virtual machines.
Jinja2 templating engine is used to customize remote configuration files.

## Getting Started

Jinja is a web template engine for the Python programming language. It is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.

Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments. It tries to simplify the software configuration management of virtualization in order to increase development productivity. Vagrant needs the VirtualBox to be installed on the same machine than Vagrant.

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. Ansible is agentless, temporarily connecting remotely via SSH to do its tasks.


### Prerequisites

We'll install VirtualBox, Vagrant and Ansible on Ubuntu.
Ubuntu builds are available in a PPA.
To configure the PPA on your machine and install Ansible run these commands:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
```

### Installation

In order to run ansible playbooks, ansible must me installed locally.
See the Official Ansible Latest Installation Guide and Jinja2 Templating User Guide links in the links section.
See also how to install Ansible on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

With VirtualBox and Vagrant some virtual machines will be created. Ansible playbooks will configure on them all is needed to test.
Find how to install VirtualBox and Vagrant in the links section.

**VAGRANT**

Vagrant can be used to to boot a Linux virtual machine inside your laptop and use it as a server to test Ansible playbooks.

Vagrant needs the VirtualBox virtualizer to be installed on your machine.

Install the VirtualBox package with (Debian):
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virtualbox
```

Optionally install the extension pack with (Debian):
```sh
sudo apt install virtualbox-ext-pack
```

Install the VirtualBox package with (Debian):
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vagrant
```

Check Vagrant installation:
```sh
vagrant --version
```


VirtualBox has made a change (restriction) to the default allowed network ranges. The allowed ranges go from 192.168.56.0/21 to 192.168.63.0/21. This behaviour can be overridden by creating a /etc/vbox/networks.conf file on the host filesystem with the following contents to unlock all allowed ranges:
```sh
* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0
```

We'll go with the 192.168.60.0/24 range.

Create a new host network adapter with IPv4 address/mask 192.168.60.0/24. The DHCP server can be disabled.
```sh
VBoxManage hostonlyif create
VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig <name> --ip 192.168.60.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0
vboxmanage dhcpserver modify --ifname <name> --disable
```

You can list host-only network interfaces:
```sh
VBoxManage list hostonlyifs
```

Create/start up vagrant machines by using:
```sh
vagrant up ([hostname1] [hostname2])
```

Stop vagrant machines by using:
```sh
vagrant halt ([hostname1] [hostname2])
```

Stop and destroy vagrant machines by using:
```sh
vagrant destroy ([hostname1] [hostname2])
```

You can SSH to a vagrant machine by using:

```sh
vagrant ssh [hostname]
```

All provisioned vagrant hosts are defined in the file named 'Vagrantfile'.

You can check the status of all VMs created with Vagrant:
```sh
vagrant global-status
```

**ANSIBLE**

The ansible config file (ansible.cfg) has been set to log in the vagrant instancies with the user name 'vagrant', using de same SSH private key file (~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key). So, I won't be necessary to create a specific user to SSH from the Ansible control node (your machine).

Ansible hosts are remote servers that are monitored and controlled by the Ansible control node.

Let's install Ansible.
* Make sure your systemâ€™s package index is up to date. Refresh the package index with the command:
```sh
sudo apt update
```
* Install Ansible on Ubuntu with the command:
```sh
sudo apt install ansible
```
Remote hosts (the vagrant instances) are defined in the hosts file (inventories/vagrant/hosts).
Every folder under the inventories folder define an environment.
In our case, we only have one environment: vagrant.
Each enviroment has its group_vars folder with the definition of variables for every role.
Each role represents a group of servers by role: all, proxy, web.
The role 'all' applies to all of the roles.

The 'inventories/vagrant' directory has been defined in the ansible.cfg file as the inventory by default.

You can check the accessible hosts by using:
```sh
ansible-inventory --list -y
```
The final step is making sure the Ansible control node connects to the remote hosts and run commands.

* To test the connection with the hosts, use the following command in the terminal on your control node:
```sh
ansible all -m ping
```

* You can also check remote hostname by using:
```sh
ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_hostname'
```

## Usage

When using Vagrant and VirtualBox to create virtual machines and Ansible as the provisioner, you can create and provision the VMs at the same time:
```sh
vagrant up --provision
```

You can specify different hostnames:
```sh
vagrant up kafka1 kafka2 kafka3 --provision
```

If any config change is made you can provision the VMs again:
```sh
vagrant provision
```

You can specify different hostnames:
```sh
vagrant provision kafka1 kafka2 kafka3
```

If you are not using Vagrant and VirtualBox, to provision and configure all specified hosts run de command:
```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

All existing tags, if any, can be listed by using:
```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --list-tags
```

While executing ansible-playbook you can refere to its specific groups of hosts and roles. For example:
```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --limit kafka
```

## Test

Let's check if the machines provisioned do what they are suposed to.

Check kafka connectivity on each cluster node:
```sh
nc -vz 192.168.60.51 9092
nc -vz 192.168.60.52 9092
nc -vz 192.168.60.53 9092
```
Kafkacat is a command line utility that you can use to test and debug Apache Kafka deployments. You can use kafkacat to produce, consume, and list topic and partition information for Kafka. 

Install kafkacat on your laptop:
```sh
sudo apt install kafkacat
```

List active brokers and topics on each node:
```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -L
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.52:9092 -L
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.53:9092 -L
```

Add the JSON (-J) option to have the output emitted as JSON. This can be useful when passing this data to other applications for further processing.

```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -L -J
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.52:9092 -L -J
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.53:9092 -L -J
```

You can easily send data to a topic using kafkacat. Run it with the -P command and enter the data you want, and then press Ctrl-D to finish:
```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic1 -P
test
^C
```

Replay it (replace -P with -C) to verify:
```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic1 -C
test
```

You can specify the key for messages, using the same -K parameter plus delimiter character that was used for the previous consumer example:
```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic1 -P -K:
1:foo
2:bar
^C

kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic1 -C -f 'Key: %k\nValue: %s\n'
Key: 1
Value: foo
Key: 2
Value: bar
```

You can set the partition:
```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic1 -P -K: -p0
1:foo1
^C
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic2 -P -K: -p0
2:foo2
^C
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic2 -P -K: -p1
2:bar2
^C
```

Replay, using the format and -f field as above:
```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic1 -C -f '\nKey (%K bytes): %k\t\nValue (%S bytes): %s\nTimestamp: %T\tPartition: %p\tOffset: %o\n--\n'

Key (1 bytes): 1	
Value (4 bytes): foo1
Timestamp: 1652804396796	Partition: 0	Offset: 0
--
% Reached end of topic topic1 [0] at offset 1
```

```sh
kafkacat -b 192.168.60.51:9092 -t topic2 -C -f '\nKey (%K bytes): %k\t\nValue (%S bytes): %s\nTimestamp: %T\tPartition: %p\tOffset: %o\n--\n'

Key (1 bytes): 2	
Value (4 bytes): foo2
Timestamp: 1652804406684	Partition: 0	Offset: 0
--

Key (1 bytes): 2	
Value (4 bytes): bar2
Timestamp: 1652804412956	Partition: 1	Offset: 0
--
% Reached end of topic topic2 [1] at offset 1
% Reached end of topic topic2 [0] at offset 1
```
